App Documentation: AI Agent Integration with Google Gemini
Overview

This application allows users to interact with the Google Gemini AI model through a custom front-end (created with lovable.dev) and a backend workflow managed by n8n.  The app takes user input, sends it to Gemini via n8n, and displays Gemini's response.

Functionality

The application works as follows:

User Input: The user enters text or a prompt in the application's front-end (lovable.dev).

Data Transmission: The front-end sends the user's input to an n8n webhook.

n8n Workflow:

The n8n workflow receives the data via the webhook.

The workflow then forwards the user's input to the Google Gemini Chat Model.

Google Gemini processes the input and generates a response.

The n8n workflow receives the response from Google Gemini.

The n8n workflow sends the response back to another webhook.

Response Display: The front-end application (lovable.dev) receives the response from the n8n webhook and displays it to the user.

Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

Front-end (lovable.dev): Provides the user interface for interacting with the application.  It handles sending user input and displaying the AI's response.

n8n: A workflow automation tool that orchestrates the interaction with the Google Gemini API. It receives data from the front-end, sends it to Gemini, receives the response, and sends the response back to the front-end.

Google Gemini: Google's large language model, which processes the user's input and generates a response.

n8n Workflow Details

Based on the image provided, the n8n workflow includes the following nodes:

Webhook (Trigger): Receives the user's input from the lovable.dev front-end via an HTTP POST request.

AI Agent (Tools Agent): This node appears to manage the interaction with the Google Gemini model.  It likely handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.  The image suggests it uses a "Chat Model", "Memory", and "Tool".

Google Gemini Chat Model: This node specifically interacts with the Google Gemini API.

Respond to Webhook: Sends the response from Google Gemini back to the lovable.dev front-end, likely as an HTTP response to the original request.

Key Features

AI-Powered Interaction: Enables users to interact with the Google Gemini AI model.

Customizable Front-end: The lovable.dev front-end allows for a tailored user experience.

Workflow Automation: n8n automates the process of sending data to and from the AI model, making the application efficient and scalable.

Integration: Integrates the front-end with the Google Gemini AI via n8n.

How to Use the App

Open the application in your web browser.

Enter your text or prompt in the input field.

Submit your input.

The application will display the response generated by the Google Gemini AI.
